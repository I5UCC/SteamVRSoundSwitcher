# SteamVRSoundSwitcher
 
Sets Sound devices if SteamVR isn't reliable enough.
Requires [nircmd](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) to be placed in the same folder for this to function.

Register the app.vrmanifest file manually by running it with SteamVR(vrmonitor.exe) to allow automatic startup with SteamVR.
